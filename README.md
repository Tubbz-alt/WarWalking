# WarWalking


The idea is to have a mobile war walking setup for fox and hound or H&S.  It needs to be small and battery operated for portability and so we dont look like a walking NSA with antennas hung off of you.

Primary focus is to get monitoring and searching and passive recon going.  Then we could add attack stuff.  But absolutly doing passive capabilities first.
